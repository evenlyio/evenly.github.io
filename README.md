## Building the website locally
### Prerequisites
You need to install the static site generator [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

To install run `gem install jekyll` in the terminal. If that fails run `gem update` and try again.

### Running the website locally
Go to the folder in Terminal where you cloned the repository (see above).

`jekyll build` creates the site from the template files.

`jekyll serve` allows you to try the page locally in your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)
