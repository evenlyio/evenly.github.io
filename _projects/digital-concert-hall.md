    - 3DAround is food photography in 3D. It allows you to capture your food (or really almost any object) in 3D using only the camera in your iPhone.
    - Together with the Swiss computer vision technology company Dacuda we built an app making use of their advanced computer vision technology. Using 3DAround you can caputure everyday objects like food and create a 3D model. This model can be uploaded and shared with your friends.
    - This app was built almost entirely in Swift using the latest iOS technologies available. It incorporates motion sensors and OpenGL and was built for iOS 8.
